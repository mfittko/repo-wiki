# Module `extractors.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides a collection of functions designed to analyze and extract various elements from source code and runtime environments. It focuses on identifying runtime hints, environment variables, exported symbols, Go package information, imports, and different types of surfaces such as migration, model, and route surfaces. The module serves as a core utility for source code introspection and extraction tasks within the codebase.

## Source file list

- `src/extractors.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `detectRuntimeHints` — Function to identify runtime-specific hints within the source.
- `extractEnvironmentVariables` — Extracts environment variables from the source or environment.
- `extractExportedSymbols` — Retrieves symbols that are exported from the source code.
- `extractGoPackage` — Extracts Go package information from the source.
- `extractImports` — Parses and extracts import statements.
- `extractMigrationSurfaces` — Identifies migration-related surfaces in the source.
- `extractModelSurfaces` — Extracts model-related surfaces.
- `extractRouteSurfaces` — Extracts route-related surfaces.
- `extractSymbols` — General symbol extraction utility.

## Dependencies and imports

- `path` — Node.js path module, used for file path manipulations.
- `typescript` — TypeScript compiler API, used for parsing and analyzing TypeScript source code.

## Related tests

No documentation or test cards are currently associated with this module. It is recommended to verify the presence of corresponding test suites in the codebase to ensure coverage of the extraction functionalities.

## Known gaps or open questions

- There is no explicit documentation or test coverage linked to this module, which may limit understanding of edge cases or intended usage.
- The exact nature and format of the "surfaces" (migration, model, route) extracted by the module are not detailed in the source cards.
- The runtime hints detection mechanism and its integration context remain unspecified.
- Further exploration of how these extraction functions are composed or consumed by other parts of the system would clarify their role.
