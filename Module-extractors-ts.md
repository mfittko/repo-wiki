# Module `extractors.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides a collection of functions designed to analyze and extract various elements from source code and runtime environments. It focuses on identifying runtime hints, environment variables, exported symbols, Go package information, imports, and different types of surfaces such as migration, model, and route surfaces. The module serves as a foundational source component for code analysis and extraction tasks, facilitating deeper inspection and processing of codebases.

## Source file list

- `src/extractors.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `detectRuntimeHints` — Function to identify runtime-specific hints within the source.
- `extractEnvironmentVariables` — Extracts environment variables from the code or environment.
- `extractExportedSymbols` — Retrieves symbols that are exported from modules or files.
- `extractGoPackage` — Extracts Go package information from source files.
- `extractImports` — Parses and extracts import statements.
- `extractMigrationSurfaces` — Identifies migration-related surfaces in the code.
- `extractModelSurfaces` — Extracts model-related surfaces.
- `extractRouteSurfaces` — Extracts route-related surfaces.
- `extractSymbols` — General symbol extraction utility.

## Dependencies and imports

- `path` — Node.js path module, used for file path manipulations.
- `typescript` — TypeScript compiler API, used for parsing and analyzing TypeScript source code.

## Related tests

No documentation or test files are currently linked or documented for this module.

## Known gaps or open questions

- There is no explicit documentation or test coverage referenced for this module, which may limit understanding of edge cases or intended usage.
- The exact nature and format of the "surfaces" (migration, model, route) extracted by the module are not detailed.
- The runtime hints detection mechanism and environment variable extraction specifics are not described.
- The source repository and commit information are unknown, which may affect traceability and versioning context.
