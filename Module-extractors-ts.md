# Module `extractors.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides a collection of functions designed to analyze and extract various elements from source code and runtime environments. It focuses on identifying runtime hints, environment variables, exported symbols, Go package information, imports, and different types of surfaces such as migration, model, and route surfaces. The module serves as a foundational source component for code analysis and extraction tasks within the project.

## Source file list

- `src/extractors.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `detectRuntimeHints` — Function to identify runtime-specific hints within the source.
- `extractEnvironmentVariables` — Extracts environment variables from the source or runtime context.
- `extractExportedSymbols` — Retrieves symbols that are exported from the source code.
- `extractGoPackage` — Extracts Go package information from the source.
- `extractImports` — Parses and extracts import statements.
- `extractMigrationSurfaces` — Identifies migration-related surfaces in the code.
- `extractModelSurfaces` — Extracts model-related surfaces.
- `extractRouteSurfaces` — Extracts route-related surfaces.
- `extractSymbols` — General symbol extraction utility.

## Dependencies and imports

- `path` — Node.js path module, used for file path manipulations.
- `typescript` — TypeScript compiler API, used for parsing and analyzing TypeScript source code.

## Related tests

No documentation or test cards are currently associated with this module. It is recommended to verify the presence and coverage of tests related to the extraction functions in the project’s test suites.

## Known gaps or open questions

- There is no explicit documentation or test coverage information available for this module.
- The exact runtime environments or contexts targeted by `detectRuntimeHints` and other extraction functions are not detailed.
- Further clarification on the nature and structure of the "surfaces" (migration, model, route) would enhance understanding.
- The module’s integration points or consumers within the larger project are not specified.
