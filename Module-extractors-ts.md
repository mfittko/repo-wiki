# Module `extractors.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides a collection of functions designed to analyze and extract various elements from source code and runtime environments. It focuses on identifying runtime hints, environment variables, exported symbols, Go package information, imports, and different types of surfaces such as migration, model, and route surfaces. The module serves as a core utility for source code introspection and extraction tasks, facilitating deeper analysis and processing of codebases.

## Source file list

- `src/extractors.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `detectRuntimeHints` — Detects hints related to runtime behavior or configuration.
- `extractEnvironmentVariables` — Extracts environment variables from the source or runtime context.
- `extractExportedSymbols` — Retrieves symbols that are exported from modules or packages.
- `extractGoPackage` — Extracts Go package information from source files.
- `extractImports` — Parses and extracts import statements.
- `extractMigrationSurfaces` — Identifies migration-related surfaces in the code.
- `extractModelSurfaces` — Extracts model-related surfaces.
- `extractRouteSurfaces` — Extracts route-related surfaces.
- `extractSymbols` — General symbol extraction utility.

## Dependencies and imports

- `path` — Node.js path module, used for file path manipulations.
- `typescript` — TypeScript compiler API, used for parsing and analyzing TypeScript source code.

## Related tests

No explicit test files or test documentation are referenced in the source cards or module metadata. It is unknown if dedicated tests exist for this module.

## Known gaps or open questions

- The module documentation and source cards do not specify detailed behavior or usage examples for the exported functions.
- There is no information about error handling, performance considerations, or integration with other modules.
- The absence of related tests or documentation leaves open questions about coverage and reliability.
- The source repository and commit information are unknown, limiting traceability.
