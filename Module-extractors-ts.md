# Module `extractors.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides a collection of functions designed to analyze and extract various elements from source code and runtime environments. It focuses on identifying runtime hints, environment variables, exported symbols, Go package information, imports, and different types of surfaces such as migration, model, and route surfaces. The module serves as a foundational source component for code analysis and extraction tasks, leveraging TypeScript and Node.js path utilities.

## Source file list

- `src/extractors.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `detectRuntimeHints` — Detects hints related to runtime behavior or configuration.
- `extractEnvironmentVariables` — Extracts environment variables from the source or runtime context.
- `extractExportedSymbols` — Retrieves symbols that are exported from a module or file.
- `extractGoPackage` — Extracts Go package information from source code.
- `extractImports` — Parses and extracts import statements.
- `extractMigrationSurfaces` — Identifies migration-related surfaces in the codebase.
- `extractModelSurfaces` — Extracts model-related surfaces.
- `extractRouteSurfaces` — Extracts route-related surfaces.
- `extractSymbols` — General symbol extraction utility.

## Dependencies and imports

- `path` — Node.js path module, used for file path manipulations.
- `typescript` — TypeScript compiler API, used for parsing and analyzing TypeScript source code.

## Related tests

No documentation or test files are currently linked or documented for this module.

## Known gaps or open questions

- There is no explicit documentation or test coverage referenced for this module, which may limit understanding of edge cases or intended usage.
- The exact nature and structure of the "surfaces" (migration, model, route) extracted by the module are not detailed.
- The module's integration context or how these extraction functions are composed or consumed is not described.
- The source repository and commit information are unknown, limiting traceability.
