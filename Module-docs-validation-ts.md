# Module: docs-validation.ts

## Purpose

This module provides utilities and functions related to validating documentation paths and route surfaces within a codebase. It includes mechanisms to build route surface indexes, clean and normalize documented path targets, collect environment variables and manifest directories, and deduplicate validation findings. The module appears to support validation workflows that ensure documentation paths and references are consistent and correctly structured.

## Source file list

- `src/docs-validation.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- **buildRouteSurfaceIndex**: Constructs an index of route surfaces, likely used to validate or analyze routing documentation.
- **candidateRepoPaths**: Represents or generates candidate repository paths for validation or analysis.
- **cleanDocumentedPathTarget**: Cleans or normalizes documented path targets to a consistent format.
- **collectKnownEnvironmentVariables**: Gathers environment variables known or relevant to the documentation or validation process.
- **collectManifestDirectories**: Collects directories containing manifest files, possibly for validation or indexing.
- **dedupeRouteValidationFindings**: Deduplicates findings from route validation to avoid redundant reports.
- **DocumentedPathSource**: A type or interface representing the source of a documented path.
- **hasParentDirectorySegment**: Checks if a path includes a parent directory segment (e.g., `..`).
- **isGeneratedOutputReference**: Determines if a path or reference points to generated output.
- **normalizeRepoPath**: Normalizes repository paths to a standard format.

## Dependencies and imports

- Node.js built-in modules:
  - `fs` (file system operations)
  - `path` (path manipulations)

## Related tests

No explicit test files or test-related documentation cards are listed for this module. It is unclear if dedicated tests exist or are integrated elsewhere.

## Known gaps or open questions

- The repository remote URL and commit SHA are unknown, limiting traceability.
- No documentation cards or test references are available, so the usage context and test coverage are unclear.
- The exact nature of some functions (e.g., how route surfaces are defined or used) is not detailed in the source excerpt.
- It is unknown if this module interacts with other modules or systems beyond the imports listed.
