# Module `docs-ingestor.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides functionality for ingesting and processing documentation related to CI workflow commands. It includes utilities to extract, classify, and create structured representations of documented commands from source files. The module supports the generation of documentation cards and the classification of commands based on their source and status, facilitating automated documentation workflows.

## Source file list

- `src/docs-ingestor.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- **CiWorkflowCommandSource**: Represents a source of CI workflow commands.
- **classifyDocumentedCommands**: Function to classify commands extracted from documentation.
- **CommandClassification**: Enum or type defining possible classifications for commands.
- **CommandSource**: Represents the origin or source context of a command.
- **CommandStatus**: Enum or type indicating the status of a command.
- **createDocumentationCard**: Function to create a structured documentation card for commands.
- **DocumentedFilePath**: Type or interface representing file paths of documented sources.
- **extractCiCommands**: Function to extract CI commands from source files.
- **extractCiCommandSources**: Function to extract sources of CI commands.
- **extractDocumentationClaims**: Function to extract claims or assertions from documentation.

## Dependencies and imports

- Internal:
  - `./docs-validation.js`: Presumably provides validation utilities related to documentation.
- Node.js built-in modules:
  - `node:fs`: File system operations.
  - `node:path`: Path utilities.

## Related tests

No explicit test files or test-related symbols are indicated in the source cards or module metadata. Further investigation in the repository may be required to locate tests related to this module.

## Known gaps or open questions

- The module does not list any associated documentation cards or test coverage in the provided metadata.
- The exact nature and structure of some types (e.g., `CommandClassification`, `CommandStatus`) are not detailed here.
- The relationship between extracted commands and their usage in CI workflows or documentation pipelines could be further clarified with additional context.
- No information on error handling or edge cases in command extraction and classification is provided.
