# Module `docs-ingestor.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides functionality for ingesting and processing documentation related to CI workflow commands. It includes utilities to extract, classify, and create structured representations of documented commands from source files. The module supports the analysis and validation of documentation claims, enabling downstream tooling to generate or verify documentation cards for CI commands.

## Source file list

- `src/docs-ingestor.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- **CiWorkflowCommandSource**: Represents a source of CI workflow commands.
- **classifyDocumentedCommands**: Function to classify commands extracted from documentation.
- **CommandClassification**: Enum or type defining classification categories for commands.
- **CommandSource**: Interface or type representing a command source.
- **CommandStatus**: Enum or type representing the status of a command.
- **createDocumentationCard**: Function to create a structured documentation card for a command.
- **DocumentedFilePath**: Type or interface representing file paths of documented sources.
- **extractCiCommands**: Function to extract CI commands from source files.
- **extractCiCommandSources**: Function to extract sources of CI commands.
- **extractDocumentationClaims**: Function to extract claims made in documentation about commands.

## Dependencies and imports

- Internal:
  - `./docs-validation.js`: Presumably provides validation utilities related to documentation.
- Node.js built-in modules:
  - `node:fs`: File system operations.
  - `node:path`: Path utilities.

## Related tests

No explicit test files or test-related symbols are indicated in the source cards or module metadata. Further investigation in the repository may be required to locate tests related to this module.

## Known gaps or open questions

- The module's documentation cards section is empty, indicating no pre-existing documentation cards are generated or maintained here.
- The exact nature and structure of some types (e.g., `CommandClassification`, `CommandStatus`) are not detailed in the source card excerpt.
- No direct references to test coverage or test files are provided.
- The repository remote URL and commit SHA are unspecified, limiting traceability.
- The timestamp of compilation is not provided, which may affect the currency of the information.
