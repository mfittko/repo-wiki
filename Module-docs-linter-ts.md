# Module `docs-linter.ts`

## Purpose

This module provides functionality related to linting documentation. It is implemented in TypeScript and serves as a source module within the codebase. The primary exported symbol is `lintDocs`, which suggests that the module's main responsibility is to perform linting operations on documentation content, likely ensuring quality and consistency.

## Source file list

- `src/docs-linter.ts`

## Key symbols and entry points

- `lintDocs`: The main exported function or symbol from this module, responsible for linting documentation.

## Dependencies and imports

The module imports several internal and external dependencies:

- Internal modules:
  - `./config.js`
  - `./docs-ingestor.js`
  - `./docs-validation.js`
  - `./utils/fs.js`

- Node.js built-in modules:
  - `node:fs`
  - `node:path`

These dependencies indicate that the module likely reads and processes documentation files, validates them, and uses configuration settings to guide the linting process.

## Related tests

No explicit test files or test-related documentation cards are listed for this module. It is unknown if tests exist or where they might be located.

## Known gaps or open questions

- No documentation cards or detailed descriptions are available, limiting insight into the specific linting rules or behaviors implemented.
- The absence of related test information leaves the testing coverage and strategy unclear.
- The repository remote URL and commit SHA are unknown, which restricts traceability to the exact source version.
- Further exploration of the imported modules could clarify the linting workflow and validation criteria.
