## Purpose

This module provides functionality related to linting documentation. It is implemented in TypeScript and serves as a source module within the codebase. The primary exported symbol is `lintDocs`, which suggests that the module's main responsibility is to perform linting operations on documentation content, likely ensuring quality and consistency.
